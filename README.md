# Graph kernels.
 
Author: Sandro Vega Pons sv.pons@gmail.com
My implementation of the following graph kernels:

General type of graphs (Assuming no node-correspondence): 
 - Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel (WL)
 - Shortest path graph kernel (SP)

Specific type of graphs (Assuming one-to-one node-correspondece):
 - Direct connection embedding + kernel for vector data (DCE)
 - Dissimilarity representation embedding + kernel for vector data (DRE)
